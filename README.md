# Laboratory 2

## Objective 
- Build a program that alllows to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a set of n numbers 

## Program Description 
The program calculates the mean and standard deviation. for this I used the method calculo that uses a linkedlist implemented in the class LinkedList. the following picture explains the classes design.

The following formulas were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

The following values were used to test the program

## Web 
The following is the web design of the program. First An intial page where the user put the data that want to calculate from.

Then the user inserts the data

Finally after submit calcular, it redirects to /respuesta where the standard deviation and mean are displayed

If the user wants to calculate another set of numbers, he can click Volver.
